{#
   This mess is solely because I'm a whitespace nut
   and I want my code comments to align vertically in the code
   snippet regardless of the legth of the column name. Twig
   doesn't have a php equivalent to str_repeat so we're making
   one that will let us repeat the space character based on
   the difference between the "current column name length" and the
   "longest column name length". Nerdy. I know.
